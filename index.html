      Novice -> Expert has 4 stages on the continuum Ignorance-Awareness-Ability-Fluency</li>

  <ul class='title'>
    <li class='description'>Browser makes request to servers which responds with files for browser to display</li>
    <li class='description'>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) Web is made of servers which host webpages</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id='struct'>Document Structure</h2>
  <ul class='title'>
    <li class='description'>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) Child elements inherit characteristics from their parents Web can be reduced to boxes (like this one)</li>
    <li class='description'>There are block as well as inline elements</li>

      <div class='txtbox'>HTML is based on a tree-like structure. A parent or root webpage represents the trunk and then child or 'branch' pages connect to it, which in turn has child pages. Code should also be structured in a similar way to have divs which contain like
        elements so that a webpage can be moved around like legos</div>
    </li>
    <li class='description'> Use classes and css to avoid repetition. Repeating code, is not only time consuming for the programmer, it also makes things harder to change and iterate. Code should work modularly so that a minimum of work needs to be done for a small change. Also
      modular code runs faster, which is something to be aware of at all stages of coding</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id='prog'> Programming</h2>
  <ul class='title'>
    <li class='description'>
      Computers run a series of instructions called a program. Higher level programming languages like python are run through a python interpreter which relays instructions to the computer that it can understand.
    </li>
    <li class='description'>
      Good to think about functions in terms of inputs that you put in (crazy I know) and outputs( what comes out after the computer processes the inputs)

    </li>
    <li class='description'>
      Variables- pointers to information stored on the RAM. Can store strings, lists, dictionaries, whatever.
    </li>
    <li class='description'>
      Functions can be part of the language or defined by the user, but basically meant to process certain inputs (lists, text, images, data of any type) and spit out the desired processed output.
    </li>
    <li class='description'>
      Debug early, debug often, it's part of dat coding lyfe doe
    </li>
    <li class='description'>
      Loops are lines of code that the computer repeatedly processes until a certain condition is met. While will loop while a certain condition is true at the beginning of each loop. For will loop through a list(series of ordered data points)</li>
    <li class='description'>Conditions are just that they check whether a certain condition is true or not (boolean) and run lines of code if that condition is true. Otherwise the computer will skip over the code inside the if condition</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id='oop'>Object Oriented Programming</h2>
  <ul class='title'>
    <li class='description'>
      Objects are pre-packaged ‘instances’ of ‘classes’ meaning they are a bundle of characteristics and functions(known as methods). Some classes are included in python (like turtle) or defined by other people and can be imported. This is very useful for larger
      projects since we can reuse code that other people have written and reduce load on ourselves.
    </li>
    <li class='description'>
      Classes can also be defined however the user wishes. Classes and functions can be put in a separate file known as a module and imported to keep things clean and modular. Though different than css classes, Python classes serve a similar function of giving
      characteristic properties to a given object.

    <li class='description'>
      Variables- pointers to information stored on the RAM. Can store strings, lists, dictionaries, whatever.
    </li>
    <li class='description'>
      Think of classes like blueprint and instances as manifestations of blueprint
      <li class='description'>
        When a class is created as a child of another class, an object of the child class will inherit aspects of the parent class as well as any methods or variables of its own. Identically named methods/variable will be overridden by the child’s definitions
        (similarly to real life it seems). This is similar to how divs inside another div will inherit properties of the parent div class.
